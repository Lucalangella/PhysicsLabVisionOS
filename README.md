# NEWTON LAB

PhysicsLabVisionOS is a **VisionOS** application built with **SwiftUI** and **RealityKit**. It serves as an interactive physics laboratory where developers can experiment with various physical properties, simulate real-world behaviors in an immersive environment, and determine the optimal values for their own applications.

The primary goal of this tool is to help you "feel" the physics (mass, friction, restitution, damping) and visualize the results (path tracing, velocity), so you can take those precise values and use them in your own RealityKit projects.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Immersive Physics Sandbox:** Run simulations in a fully immersive 3D space.
*   **Mixed Reality & Virtual Modes:**
    *   **Mixed:** Interact with your real-world surroundings using Scene Reconstruction (LiDAR) and Hand Tracking.
    *   **Virtual:** A controlled environment with generated floors, walls, and ramps.
*   **Real-time Tuning:** Instantly adjust physics properties via the UI:
    *   **Mass**
    *   **Restitution** (Bounciness)
    *   **Static & Dynamic Friction**
    *   **Linear Damping** & **Air Density** (Advanced Drag)
*   **Shape Switching:** Test physics on different primitives (Box, Sphere, Cylinder).
*   **Tools & Visualizers:**
    *   **Path Tracing:** Visualize the trajectory of moving objects.
    *   **Ramp Generator:** Create adjustable ramps to test sliding and friction.
    *   **Velocity Monitoring:** Real-time speed feedback.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   **Drag & Drop:** Pick up and throw objects with natural gestures.
    *   **Magnify:** Resize objects to see how scale affects interactions.

## 🛠 Usage for Developers

This app is designed to be a utility for your workflow.

1.  **Play & Tune:**
    *   Launch the app on Apple Vision Pro (or Simulator).
    *   Enter the Immersive Space.
    *   Use the control panel to tweak physics parameters (e.g., increase `Restitution` to make a ball bouncier, adjust `Friction` to stop sliding).
    *   Throw or drop the object to see the behavior.

2.  **Capture the Values:**
    *   Once you find the behavior you like (e.g., a specific "slide" feel on a ramp), look at the values set in the UI.
    *   **Pro Tip:** Tap the **"Print Values"** button in the bottom toolbar. This will log the exact configuration to the Xcode Console, so you can just copy-paste the numbers.

3.  **Implement in Your App:**
    Use the values you found (or copied from the console) in your own code:

    ```swift
    // Example: Applying values found in PhysicsLabVisionOS
    let material = PhysicsMaterialResource.generate(
        staticFriction: 0.8,  // Value from Lab
        dynamicFriction: 0.6, // Value from Lab
        restitution: 0.5      // Value from Lab
    )

    var physicsBody = PhysicsBodyComponent(
        massProperties: .init(mass: 2.5), // Value from Lab
        material: material,
        mode: .dynamic
    )
    physicsBody.linearDamping = 0.1 // Value from Lab
    
    entity.components.set(physicsBody)
    ```

## 🏗 Project Structure

*   **`PhysicsSceneManager.swift`**: The core logic engine. It handles RealityKit entities, physics updates, ARKit scene reconstruction, and hand tracking.
*   **`ImmersiveView.swift`**: The main SwiftUI view for the immersive space. It bridges SwiftUI state (sliders/buttons) to the `PhysicsSceneManager`.
*   **`AppViewModel.swift`**: Holds the state of the simulation (current physics values, selected modes, UI toggles).

## ⚙️ Requirements

*   **Xcode 15.0+**
*   **visionOS 1.0+**
*   **Apple Vision Pro** (for full AR/Hand Tracking features) or **visionOS Simulator**.
